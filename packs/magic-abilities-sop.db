Choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Choose a creature within your alter time range. You can alter the past so that you sought out and influenced that creature recently. Make a Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Persuasion), or Charisma (Intimidate) ability check to influence the target’s attitude or otherwise manipulate its behavior. The creature is treated as if you had made the check in the past. The creature must have been in a place you could have reasonably found it within the past 1 day per level, or else the effect fails, though you do not lose the spell point. This ability does not increase the duration of the outcome of the chosen ability check. You can expend up to 10 gp per level as part of this ability check for bribes or similar payments. This application cannot cause creatures to appear in a place they would not have otherwise been (so you can retroactively bribe a guard to let you pass, but you cannot pay him to hire mercenaries on your behalf).</li>\n<li><strong>Purchase:</strong> You can retroactively obtain a generic object worth less than 100 gp per level. The object immediately appears on your person or in a container or extradimensional space in your possession. The cost of the item is immediately deducted from the wealth you currently carry. The object must be one that would have been available in a settlement you have visited within the past 1 week per level. If you specify an item that could not have been purchased, the casting fails, but the spell point is not expended.</li>\n<li><strong>Research:</strong> You can alter the past to have spent time researching a subject. You have expertise (you add your proficiency bonus twice) when making Intelligence checks regarding a specific subject (you could choose “green dragons” or “this city” but not “arcana” or “geography”) for 1 hour, provided you have been near a location where you could have accessed reference materials within the past 1 week per level, retroactively spending time to research the subject. You can expend up to 100 gp per level to gain access to such research materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wealth spent on this ability is usually coins, but can be non-magical gemstones or other non-magical objects used for trade, and must be accessible to you at the time the effect is cast. You cannot spend wealth that you do not possess.

You can also include willing creatures in the effect, allowing an ally to make the ability checks or obtain the item(s). Each ally included counts against the Mass (metasphere) limit. Each casting may only select one of the options; you cannot influence a creature while obtaining an item or researching a subject.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":0,"school":"enc","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

(Casters with the Utterances talent may include verbal components with no extra save required). You can also allow this magic to work in either direction, allowing a willing target to control you or vice versa (for example, a friendly rogue might pick a lock that only you can reach using your hands, or you might use your own painting skills to paint a picture through a friendly paladin’s hands to impress a dignitary).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":0,"school":"enc","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

Forms constitute a creature’s basic physical makeup (humanoid, draconic, animalistic, avian, etc.) while traits are special characteristics or alterations (natural weapons, creature size, special abilities, etc.).</p>\n<p>The target’s current physical makeup changes completely into that of the new form, its appearance changes into something of your choice that matches its new shape (although your control is not fine enough to mimic a specific individual creature), and it loses any special abilities, natural weapons, speaking ability, or movement types that were dependent on the old form, gaining new ones in their place. Unless their new form prevents the target from supplying the necessary components of their magic, such as hands for Somatic Casting or speech for Verbal Casting, shapeshifted targets do not lose their ability to use magic sphere talents or abilities unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<p>In addition to the benefits listed in the (genotype) talent, you can grant the target 1 trait, plus an additional trait at 5th level (two traits), 11th level (three traits), and 17th level (four traits). You cannot grant the same trait more than once unless the trait indicates it may be granted multiple times.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can target unwilling creatures; they are allowed a Constitution saving throw to negate the effect. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make a new Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends for that creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<p>A target may only be affected by one shapeshift at any one time. If a caster attempts to place a second shapeshift on a target, he must succeed at a spellcasting ability check against the spell save DC or sphere DC of the caster of the existing effect. If he succeeds, the second shapeshift is successfully placed on the target, suppressing the first (which continues to expend its duration even while suppressed). The Transformation feat, the wild shape ability of the druid class, spells like alter self, animal shapes, polymorph, and shapechange, and other similar powers all count as a shapeshift for this purpose, although alternate sources of specific physical traits (for example, a class feature that lets you grow claws) still function.</p>\n<p>The target chooses whether it’s equipment falls to the ground in it’s space, merges into its new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s form and size. The equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until the shapeshift ends.</p>\n<p>If a talent or trait has a listed AC, this AC does not stack with any worn armor unless noted; use the higher value. Shields may be applied normally, though not all forms have the limbs required to wield them.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Some traits grant natural weapons, such as bites, claws, spines, talons, etc. These abilities alter the target’s unarmed strike, letting them change the damage die and damage type. Some might also grant special abilities that further augment their use. Some natural weapons require the target to have a particular set of limbs; a creature without the required limb cannot gain the natural weapons, and cannot put two natural weapons on the same limb (for example, if you have one head, you could only gain one bite weapon).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"con","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":0,"school":"trs","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

Creatures may attempt a new Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames at the end of each of their turns. Using an action to roll on the ground or to use a blanket to smother the flames automatically extinguishes the flame. A successful Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and negates catching fire. You can use this ability to relight a non-magical fire within range that was extinguished (through magical or mundane means) since the end of your last turn.
