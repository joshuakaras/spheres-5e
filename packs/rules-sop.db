{"_id":"37pzQVQdJxWr3QMr","name":"Illusions","content":"<h2 id=\"toc1\">Belief vs Disbelief</h2>\n<p>In a world of magic, unless a creature knows they are dealing with an illusionist, they will not automatically doubt anything they see; a guard familiar with a city streets might know that an illusionary wall wasn’t dividing the street yesterday, but they won’t automatically know it is an illusion; it very well might be a real wall summoned by a Creation caster instead. Likewise, a caster who appears to summon monsters to aid in a fight might be creating illusions, or summoning actual monsters.</p>\n<p>Thus, even if an NPC has a reason to be suspicious of an illusion, they will need to at least use an action to attempt to disbelieve an illusionary wall before charging through it, or spend an action attacking an illusionary creature to see their attack go through it (or, if the illusion is being actively guided by the illusionist or possesses the Intelligent Illusions talent, spend a few rounds attacking it before they become suspicious that the illusion ‘somehow’ keeps dodging every attack). It is only if they know they are facing an illusionist (such as by having seen through their earlier illusions) that they might charge through the wall without waiting to examine it or ignore the creatures summoned to attack it, but even then they risk a clever magic user who places illusions the first time, then summons real walls and creatures the second time when the guards are primed to ignore them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\">Covering Objects with Figments</h2>\n<p>While the Illusionary Disguise talent can allow you to change the appearance of a creature or object, it is also possible to place a figment on top of something to hide it. For example, you could place a figment on top of a creature to give the impression it is transforming into a monster, or hide a door behind a figment of a rock. These figments, however, do not move with the creature or object they are placed over (they must be moved as an action by the caster), and also have the chance to be disbelieved and therefore turn transparent once uncovered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\">Illusionary Cover</h2>\n<p>While summoning a figment of a wall might discourage someone from trying to attack you through it, the cover is not real, and so therefore does not actually provide cover if the target attempts to attack. If the attack succeeds, the attacker will have seen their attack pass through the illusion and will know the cover is fake.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\">Automatic Disbelief</h2>\n<p>Remember that once a target has seen proof that a figment is illusionary (for example, a guard shoots an arrow through an illusionary wall, or a guard sees the PCs enter the illusion of a rock, or sees ranged attacks coming from inside a rock), they automatically disbelieve the figment, and therefore automatically can see through it. A creature does not need to be next to an illusion to examine it, interact with it (throwing or firing ranged weapons can do so), or see something pass through it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc5\">Alternative Uses</h2>\n<p>Illusions can be used in ways not tied to fooling someone. You could use an audible illusion to throw your voice and whisper messages at a distance. You could use visible illusions to show someone the image of a person or map you have seen.</p>\n<p>An Illusionary Disguise with Greater Illusion could be used to give advantage on a check made with cooking utensils (in essence, covering up any mistakes in the cooking with pleasant smells and tastes), or a figment could be used to make a Performance check to entertain.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"stLJV7RbpOAPaFAU":3},"flags":{}}

An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.</sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc6\">Examples</h3>\n<p>The number of objects a caster could create and the uses of those objects are virtually endless, and many details will need to be determined by the DM. However, the following rules and guidelines should help provide specific examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes on Walls and Coverings:</strong> If you create a wall (a large but thin object along a single plane) A 5 foot by 5 foot square is considered a Small object. If creating cloth, a 5 foot by 5 foot square is considered a Tiny object.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes on Casings:</strong> If you try to create an encasement over a creature (for example, covering a creature with a stone dome), it counts as creating an object 1 size larger than the intended target. Thus, a casing for a Medium creature is a Large object, a casing for a Large creature is a Huge object, etc. A creature is allowed a Dexterity saving throw to escape such an entrapment, moving them outside the targeted space in a direction of their choosing. Creatures may always attack their own casing.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes on Falling Objects:</strong> If you create an object with the intent that it falls on something else to damage it, this requires a spell attack, and if successful, deals damage based on the object’s size according to Table: Object Size. Particularly soft objects might deal no damage (for example, when dropping cloth).</p>\n<p>The above assumes you are dropping an object from a height of about 15-60 feet. If dropping from a lesser height, you have advantage on your spell attack but deal half damage. If dropping from a greater height, you have disadvantage on your spell attack but deal double damage. The damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) depends on the shape of the object being dropped. Objects not designed to be weapons suffer their own falling damage.</p>\n<p>If you drop an object that is larger than what it is landing on, the target (or targets) in the area instead makes a Dexterity saving throw to avoid damage, gaining advantage against a drop from a great height and disadvantage against a drop from a short height.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc7\">Table: Object Size</h3>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Object Size</th>\n<th>Example Object</th>\n<th>Falling Damage (to both object and target)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>Dagger</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>Chair</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Table</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Statue</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Wagon</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>Catapult</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"stLJV7RbpOAPaFAU":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"oVDZajbsd53M4GY2","name":"Additional Combat Actions","content":"<h2 id=\"toc2\">Aided Acrobatics</h2>\n<p>It is possible to perform some acrobatic actions with the aid of a tool. Some examples are given below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Polevault:</strong> Use a 10-foot pole, polearm, quarterstaff, or spear to pole vault as an Action, letting you treat your Strength or Dexterity score as 10 higher when determining your jump’s distance or height.</li>\n<li><strong>Bomb Jump:</strong> Throw an explosive behind you as an Action to treat your Strength or Dexterity as 10 higher when determining your jump’s distance or height.</li>\n<li><strong>Combat Sledding:</strong> Ride downhill on a sled or shield to let you take a Dash action as a bonus action.</li>\n<li><strong>Aided Climb:</strong> Use daggers, pickaxes, or some other one-handed piercing weapons to climb a wall that would otherwise be unclimbable.</li>\n<li><strong>Aided Fall:</strong> Use daggers, pickaxes, a tanglefoot bag, or some other piercing weapon as a Reaction to stick to a wall and stop your fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Gliding:</strong> Use a cloak as a Reaction during a running jump to glide 1 foot horizontally for each 2 feet fallen vertically. When performing any such action, you must usually pass a Hard Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 20) to keep from failing and falling prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\">Climb onto a Bigger Creature</h2>\n<p>When dealing with a creature two sizes larger than yourself, you may treat that creature as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature’s space and clings to its body. While in the target’s space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p>The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature’s space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature’s ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature’s location, and is left to your discretion.</p>\n<p>The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action - knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it - by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.\\</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Dirty Trick</h2>\n<p>As an action, you may attempt to gouge a creature’s eyes, kick dirt in its face, box its ears, tangle its limbs together, tie their clothing in a knot, or any other, similarly underhanded maneuver. You must make a Dexterity ability (Sleight of Hand) check contested by that creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The GM determines the exact dirty tricks available depending on what the target is wearing, what is nearby, or how you plan to inhibit it. Depending on the exact dirty trick performed, if you succeed, you could make the creature deafened for 1 minute, knock the target prone, the target’s movement speed is reduced by half for 1 minute, the target is grappled for 1 round, or blind the target for 1 round, or something else similar. Usually, a target can spend an action to rub out their eyes, untie their clothing, or otherwise undo the dirty trick and end this effect early.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\">Disarm</h2>\n<p>A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.</p>\n<p>The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature or disadvantage if it is smaller.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Grapple</h2>\n<p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix B).</p>\n<p>The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>\n<p><strong>Escaping a Grapple:</strong> A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature:</strong> You can drag or carry the grappled creature with you when you move, but your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Help</h2>\n<p>When using the Help action, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s Attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first Attack roll is made with advantage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Overrun</h2>\n<p>When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature’s space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature’s Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\">Rope Swing</h2>\n<p>You can use a secured chain or rope, a grappling hook, a Tether magic talent (see the Destruction, Telekinesis, or Universal (manabond) spheres in Spheres of Power), or a whip or tendril to swing around the battlefield. There must be something present for the item to attach to (for example, you could lash a chandelier, but not a blank bit of wall). Attaching such an item requires an action and that the anchor spot be within the item’s reach. Treat a grappling hook as having a reach of 30 feet for this purpose. You can make an anchor spot on a creature at least 2 sizes bigger than you, but this requires an attack roll.</p>\n<p>Once your rope or weapon is secured, as part of your normal movement you may attempt to move to any other legal square on the ground that is within the rope or weapon’s reach as determined from the anchor point. Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must still have a clear path towards the destination. Dislodging your weapon or item requires another action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Shove Aside</h2>\n<p>A creature can use the shove action to force a target to the side rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sleight of Hand</h2>\n<p>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Steal</h2>\n<p>You may make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as an action to take something from a target. This is contested by their Wisdom (Perception) skill if they are not aware of you, or their Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) skill if they are aware of you. You have disadvantage on this check if the target object is securely fastened (such as a backpack they are wearing or a sword inside its scabbard at their belt). You may plant an item instead of taking an item with a similar check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc5\">Tumble</h2>\n<p>A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature’s space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"stLJV7RbpOAPaFAU":3},"flags":{}}
