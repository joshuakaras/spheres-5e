You gain the following blast type:</p>\n<p>@Item[90ChYd8mB6VQuQ44]{Destructive Blast: Thunder}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Blast Shape Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Aura</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round.</p>\n<p>Your destructive blast becomes an aura that you can surround yourself with that extends 10 feet from you. While this aura is active, you can spend a bonus action to affect all creatures within the aura with your destructive blast. Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target. As this is a single, ongoing blast, the blast type and other parameters are set at the time of casting.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The duration increases to Concentration, up to 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Blade</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action or bonus action, chosen at the time of casting.<br /><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>\n<p>Your destructive blast targets and imbues weapons and ammunition. Choose one melee weapon, natural weapon, unarmed strike, or up to 20 pieces of ammunition within range. The damage type dealt by the weapon or ammunition changes to that of the chosen blast type. Attacks made in this way do not inflict any additional damage or effects of the blast type, except as described below:</p>\n<p>After damaging a creature with an imbued weapon or ammunition, the wielder may spend a bonus action to apply the blast type’s rider effect to the damaged creature as if they were damaged by the destructive blast. Critical hits made with imbued weapons or ammunition deal an additional 1d6 damage of the chosen blast type, increasing by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). This additional damage is not rolled twice, but rather added to the total damage dealt.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can affect a number of additional melee weapons, natural weapons, unarmed strikes, or sets of 20 pieces of ammunition equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Chain Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>Your destructive blast arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. A target may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When a target fails their saving throw against your destructive blast, as a bonus action you can cause the destructive blast to leap to one or more additional targets. You can have the destructive blast leap to a total number of targets in a round equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target must be within 30 feet of the previous target and within your destructive blast range. No target may be struck by the blast more than once. This augment is chosen when the first target fails their saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Explosive Orb</strong></h3>\n<p>Your destructive blast targets a 5-foot cube. Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp: [Globe]</strong> The explosive orb materializes in your hand as a tiny globe about the size of a sling stone. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a normal range of 20 feet, long range of 60 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the destructive blast. Even if thrown through a weapon, it deals only the destructive blast damage, and the attack cannot be used with the Striking (metasphere) talent. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. A creature may shatter a globe within its reach as an action or bonus action or by spending 5 feet of movement while moving through the globe’s space. Creatures unaware of the globe that move through its space have a 50% chance of shattering it. You cannot have more globes made at a time than your proficiency bonus, and you can treat a globe as if it were an Alchemy sphere formula that may be thrown for the purpose of interacting with the Trap sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When using the globe augment, the globe persists for 8 hours. If you are within destructive blast range of the globe, you can cause it to explode as a reaction. At the end of this time, it explodes or dissipates. This choice is made at the time of casting.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The affected area is instead a sphere with a radius of up to 20 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Leap</strong></h3>\n<p>Your destructive blast becomes a 5 foot wide by 10 foot long line. When you use this blast shape, you appear in the last square of the line after the effect is resolved (or the nearest available space). Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target. You do not count as having passed through any intermediate space and do not provoke opportunity attacks for moving.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Increase the length of the line by any amount you wish, up to your destructive blast range.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can arrive at any point along the line after the effect is resolved, provided it is an unoccupied space.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Ray</strong></h3>\n<p>You can shoot your destructive blast as a ray, making a ranged spell attack. You can make a melee spell attack instead, if the target is within your natural reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can shoot 2 rays. The number of rays you can shoot increases by 1 at 5th level (3 rays), 11th level (4 rays), and 17th level (5 rays), but no creature or object can be targeted by more than a single ray.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Retribution</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Augment 1 sp:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> You may use this destructive blast as a reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature within range that you can see. Your destructive blast surrounds and affects the creature that damaged you. The affected target can make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Sculpt</h3>\n<p><strong>Range:</strong> self<br /><strong>Area:</strong> varies; see augment</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Your destructive blast affects a 5-foot radius area, centered within range. You can exclude yourself from this area. Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Your destructive blast becomes either a 30-foot cone or a 120-foot by 5-foot line, each emanating from a point within range. Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Sphere</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>\n<p>Your destructive blast takes the form of a 5-foot-diameter sphere, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. Any creature that enters the sphere’s space is affected by your destructive blast. Affected targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature may attempt a Dexterity saving throw to negate the sphere’s damage and the sphere stops moving this turn, ending its movement in the space immediately prior to the creature. The sphere flies and is never at risk of falling.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The duration increases to Concentration, up to 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Tether</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>\n<p>Your destructive blast tethers the target to you. Make a melee (if the target is within your natural reach) or ranged spell attack against a creature or object within 30 feet to deal your destructive blast damage and tether the target to you. The target cannot move away from you unless you allow it. For as long as the tether persists, neither you nor the target can move more than 30 feet away from each other. Either may attempt to drag the other, requiring a contested Strength check; if the moving creature wins the check, it may move up to half its speed, dragging the other. Creatures two or more sizes larger can’t be dragged and may move freely at full speed, dragging the smaller creature. For as long as the tether remains, you can deal destructive blast damage to the tethered target as a bonus action. Tethered targets may avoid this damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target. As this is a single, ongoing blast, the blast type and other parameters are set at the time of casting.</p>\n<p>The tether has AC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus and 3 hit points per level, which refresh at the beginning or your turn. The tether has immunity to psychic damage and the damage type matching that of the destructive blast.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Wall</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> concentration, up to 1 minute</p>\n<p>Your destructive blast becomes a 5-foot-by-5-foot panel wall that lasts for the duration. Panels of the wall must be placed on a flat surface. Creatures passing through your wall suffer your destructive blast’s damage and effects. Creatures standing in the wall’s space when it is created are allowed a Dexterity saving throw to avoid this damage, but if the final spell point cost of your destructive blast is 1 or more spell points, a successful save instead reduces the damage by half and negates any rider effects the (blast type) would otherwise inflict upon its target. Upon a successful save, the creature may choose which side of the wall to be on, otherwise you choose (the creature must be able to fit in the available space on the chosen side).</p>\n<p>The wall does not block line of effect, sight, projectiles, or thrown objects. An individual creature cannot be damaged by a destructive blast with this blast shape more than once per turn, regardless of how many times they enter or pass through a panel. The maximum number of panels you can create doubles at 5th level (2 panels), 11th level (4 panels), and 17th level (8 panels). Each panel must be contiguous with another panel.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can instead create a sphere or hemispherical dome with a maximum radius no greater than the width or height of your panel.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The maximum width and height of each panel increases by 5 feet (10-foot-by-10-foot), increasing again at 5th level (15-foot-by-15-foot), 11th level (20-foot-by-20-foot), and 17th level (25-foot-by-25-foot).</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can create twice as many panels; 1st level (2 panels), 5th level (4 panels), 11th level (8 panels), and 17th level (16 panels).</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> the wall blocks sight and moving through the wall requires 5 feet of movement. If you are of 11th level or higher, non-magical projectiles that pass through the wall are destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Other Talents</h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc81\"><strong>Blaster Adept</strong></h3>\n<p>Choose one damage type. When you roll damage for a destructive blast dealing the chosen damage type, you can add your key ability modifier to the damage dealt.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> As a reaction, when you roll damage for a destructive blast that deals damage of the chosen type, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3 for that round.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent multiple times, each time choosing a different damage type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc82\"><strong>Energy Weapon</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">You conjure a weapon that you are proficient with, which appears to be made out of solidified energy.

Unlike other spheres and talents that typically limit the use of one talent at a time, many of these talents can be stacked together. Some of the talents alter the base-functionality of @Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.ep8O2kpXxlNTpfbx]{Teleport}, and those are signified by new abilities. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Attack Portal</strong></h3>\n<p>You can ready a teleport, allowing you to redirect someone's attack. You gain the following teleport effect: </p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.pa3qb7RLLY0on2sg]{Teleport: Attack Portal}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Distant Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p>When you spend a spell point to augment the distance of your teleport, the distance increases to 60 feet at 1st level, 120 feet at 5th level, 300 feet at 11th level, and 600 feet at 17th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Emergency Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p>You can perform a teleport as a reaction. You gain the following teleport effect:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.BZSnFPuqqaRkoZZp]{Teleport: Emergency Teleport}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Imbue Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p>When you would teleport a target, you can imbue them with the ability to teleport instead of immediately teleporting them. You gain the following teleport augment: </p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you would teleport a target, you can imbue them with the ability to teleport instead of immediately teleporting them. The imbued target gains the ability to teleport itself once with the same details (such as distance, talents, spell point expenditures) as you used with the original casting. However, the target may only teleport themselves and not others.</p>\n<p>The imbued teleport remains until either the target or the caster completes a short or long rest or until it is used once. You can maintain one imbued teleport at a time, increasing by 1 at 5th level (2 imbued teleports), 11th level (3 imbued teleports), and 17th level (4 imbued teleports).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Isoport</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you teleport a target you can change their orientation and lower their velocity. This allows you to turn the target up to 360 degrees, which lets you turn them while moving (counting the movement as a straight line), either give or remove the prone condition, and cancel out momentum-based movement (such as falling, being thrown or pushed), which effectively resets any distance they’ve fallen. Using this talent to respond to actions or events outside of your turn typically requires a readied action.</p>\n<p>You can choose to apply only the effects of Isoport, changing a target’s spatial orientation and velocity without teleporting them to another location. Doing so reduces the casting time to a bonus action instead of an action. You must still apply Unwilling Teleport to affect unwilling targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can Isoport a target as a reaction.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Quick Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The casting time of teleport is reduced to 1 bonus action.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you teleport yourself or a group that includes you, you can teleport in place of your movement for that round instead of as an action. Having a movement speed of 0 does not prevent you from being able to teleport in this fashion.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Recall</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Before you teleport yourself or a willing ally, you can designate the target’s current square as a recall point as a bonus action. At the end of each round, the target may choose to return to the recall point, teleporting there without spending an action so long as it is within the maximum distance that you can teleport a target. The recall point lasts for 1 minute or until used once, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> This ability no longer requires a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Segmented Warp</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When teleporting yourself, you can split the teleport in two. You cast a single teleport on yourself and pay any spell point costs once, but may teleport yourself twice in quick succession. Between these two teleports you can only take one action of any kind you have remaining (such as a single action or single bonus action). Casting the second teleport does not require a second action, but counts as casting a sphere effect. The combined total distance covered by both teleports cannot be longer than the maximum distance that you can teleport a target. If your second teleport is disrupted, it is lost.</p>\n<p>If used in conjunction with Attack Portal you do not get extra attacks, but may make your attack after either half of the split teleport. Attacking this way counts as your single action for the purposes of Segmented Warp.</p>\n<p>If you choose to augment Attack Portal to allow an attack action because you used it as a reaction, you can instead use any number of your attacks as the single allowed action, and use any remaining attacks after your second teleport. Other abilities that would create additional effects with your teleport only apply to one of the split teleports.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Splinter</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain the following teleport effect, which requires Unwilling Teleport: </p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.rQ0Yqi6qT02FtyZt]{Teleport: Splinter}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Swap Placement</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When teleporting yourself or another creature to a location already occupied by a different creature, you can send the creature already occupying that location back to where the teleporting creature came from. This must be a willing target unless you possess the Unwilling Teleport talent. If the second target is unwilling, you must pay the augmentation cost of Unwilling Teleport (this cost is only paid once even if both targets are unwilling) and it is allowed a saving throw as normal. If any unwilling creature succeeds on its saving throw, the teleporting creature remains at their point of origin, unaffected.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Teleport Beacon</strong></h3>\n<p>You can designate a personal dimensional beacon, which allows you to teleport back to it, regardless of the range. You gain the following ability:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.n93Edfn95uZLCu3p]{Teleport Beacon}</p>\n<p>In addition, your teleport gains the following augment:</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can teleport yourself to your teleport beacon regardless of how far away it is, so long as it is on the same plane. If your teleport beacon is a creature or object, you can instead teleport your teleport beacon to you. You must use the Unwilling Teleport talent to do this with an unwilling creature, and they are allowed a saving throw as normal.</p>\n<p>If you possess multiple teleport beacons and the Mass (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, you can use the Mass (metasphere) talent to teleport multiple teleport beacons at once, as if you were touching all affected targets. All affected teleport beacons must be teleported to the same location (you, or an unaffected teleport beacon of your choice).</p>\n<p>If you possess the Planeshift advanced talent, you can use it to augment this ability to function across planar boundaries.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Teleport Object</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can teleport objects independent of people. The object must be Tiny size and cannot weigh more than 10 pounds per level, and it cannot be in the possession of another creature (in their hand or on their person). If a creature is willing, you can teleport the object directly into their hand or onto their person.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Reaching (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, you can, as a readied action, catch a projectile out of the air that passes within range, redirecting it against another target if you wish. The creature who initiated the attack is allowed a Wisdom saving throw to negate this effect, and you must make a spell attack roll against the new target. Damage is still determined by the creature who initiated the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The maximum teleported object increases to Small size and 100 pounds per level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Unseeing Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When using teleport, you no longer require line of sight to the location; instead of choosing a spot to appear, you can instead indicate a direction and distance. If the target arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, the target takes 4d6 force damage and the spell fails to teleport it.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When the target or targets of a teleport arrives inside a solid object, they return to its point of origin unharmed. This augment may be applied at the time the targets arrive in the solid object without any action required.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Unwilling Teleport</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can target unwilling creatures that you can see with your teleport as long as they are within the range of your teleport sphere ability. The unwilling creature is allowed a Wisdom saving throw to negate being teleported. An unwilling creature can only be teleported into open areas on solid surfaces (thus, they can’t be teleported into the air or into a solid object, and any such attempt instantly fails). In addition, they gain advantage on their saving throw if the location would be directly harmful to them (onto a bed of spikes, the trigger area of a trap, etc.).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Advanced Talents</h1>\n<p>WIP</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wag9F71FyJMSfLz4"}}}

You can expend your drunk status to automatically roll maximum damage with an unarmed strike.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Drunken Insight</strong></h3>\n<p>You can reroll one failed Intelligence or Wisdom-based ability check, but you must take the new result, even if it is worse. Each time you use this talent beyond the first, you take a cumulative -1 penalty on the reroll granted by this talent. This count is reset by completing a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc7\"><strong>False Courage</strong></h3>\n<p>As a reaction made in response to gaining the frightened condition, you can ignore the frightened condition until the beginning of your next turn. When you use this reaction, at the beginning of your next turn you can make a Wisdom saving throw against one source of the frightened condition from which you are currently suffering, ending that effect on a successful save. If the effect does not normally have a saving throw, treat the DC as 8 + the creator of the effect’s proficiency modifier + the creator’s key ability modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc8\"><strong>Had A Few </strong></h3>\n<p>You gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to your level for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc9\"><strong>Menacing Belch</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can force one creature within 30 feet that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Affected creatures can make a new saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end this effect early. Once a creature has failed a saving throw against this ability, it has advantage on further saving throws against it from the same source until that source completes a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc10\"><strong>Miracle Drink</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma (your choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). This cannot cause the chosen score to be greater than 20.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc11\"><strong>Nice And Loose</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever subject to a Dexterity saving throw or making an ability check to escape a grapple or restraints, you can expend your drunk status to grant yourself advantage on the roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc12\"><strong>Purge</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action or bonus action, you can cause yourself to throw up, granting yourself a new saving throw against any ingested poison from which you are currently suffering, with advantage. In addition, select one square adjacent to you. That square becomes difficult terrain for the next minute. If a creature enters that square while moving at more than half its speed, it must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. For every 5 levels, you can select an additional adjacent square to affect. Clearing a square of difficult terrain is an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc13\"><strong>Reeling Steps</strong></h3>\n<p>You can expend your drunk status to take the Disengage action as a bonus action. Alternatively, you can expend your drunk status to impose disadvantage on one attack roll against you as a reaction.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc14\"><strong>Steady Nerves</strong></h3>\n<p>You can expend your drunk status to negate disadvantage on a ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Fragile Talents</h1>\n<h3 id=\"toc16\"><strong>Amp Up</strong></h3>\n<p>You can momentarily clear your mind by breaking an object against oneself. You can, as a bonus action, break a fragile object and expend a Hit Die to grant yourself advantage on saving throws against being charmed, confused (including the confusion spell and similar effects), or frightened for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc17\"><strong>Concussion</strong></h3>\n<p>By breaking an object over a creature’s head, you provoke uncontrolled action. After successfully hitting a creature with a fragile weapon, you can break that weapon. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be confused for 1 minute. A confused target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. You can expend your martial focus as a reaction to increase the result of the d10 rolled by your key ability modifier.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>d10</th>\n<th>Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-6</td>\n<td>The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>The creature can act and move normally.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At the end of each of its turns, a confused target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target, and it cannot be confused by this talent again for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc18\"><strong>Improvised Shield</strong></h3>\n<p>You can wield a weapon or improvised weapon as an improvised shield until the start of your next turn; this decision is made at the start of your turn and does not require any action.</p>\n<p>When wielding an improvised shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC as if equipped with a shield, but you cannot use that item to attack. An improvised shield counts as a regular shield for the Shield sphere.</p>\n<p>Whenever you are wielding a fragile shield, and a creature makes a critical hit against you, as a reaction you can break your shield to change the critical hit into a normal hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Jagged Edge</strong></h3>\n<p>You know how to break an object to use its jagged edges to your advantage. When rolling damage with a fragile weapon, you can break that weapon to deal an additional 1d6 damage. The amount of damage increases by one step at 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Lodged Fragment</strong></h3>\n<p>By leaving shards, slivers, or splinters in the armor or hide of a creature, you open them up to future attacks. After successfully hitting a creature with a fragile weapon, you can break that weapon to impose a -1 penalty to AC for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with other uses of this talent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3 id=\"toc22\"><strong>Barroom Expert</strong></h3>\n<p>When wielding improvised weapons that bear no resemblance to a standard weapon (including throwing a melee weapon or using a ranged weapon to make a melee attack), they deal 1d6 damage instead of 1d4, and you can treat these weapons as if they had the thrown (20/60) and finesse weapon properties, and either the light or the versatile (1d8) property (GM’s choice, depending on the item. For example, a stein would be a light weapon, while a heavy sack of flour would be a versatile (1d8) weapon).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc23\"><strong>Bottle Rocket</strong></h3>\n<p>When throwing a weapon (including improvised weapons), you treat it as if it had the thrown (40/120) weapon property, unless it already has a higher range.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc24\"><strong>Double Chug</strong></h3>\n<p>You can draw and drink two drinks, be they alcoholic or magical potions, as an action. If you do this with alcoholic drinks, this doubles the drunk status’ duration and allows you to expend your drunk status twice before actually losing it. You must have two open hands in order to perform a double chug.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc25\"><strong>Focusing Break</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever an enemy deals damage to or breaks an improvised weapon or shield you are using, you can regain martial focus as a reaction.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc26\"><strong>Focusing Buzz</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you imbibe a non-magical alcoholic drink, you can use a bonus action to regain your martial focus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc27\"><strong>Good For What Ails Ya</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you imbibe a non-magical alcoholic drink, you can use a bonus action to spend a Hit Die to heal yourself.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc28\"><strong>High on Fumes</strong></h3>\n<p>You can expend your martial focus as a bonus action to gain the drunk status as though you had imbibed an alcoholic beverage. This still counts against your total number of drinks per long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc29\"><strong>Iron Liver</strong></h3>\n<p>Increase the number of drinks you can consume before gaining the poisoned condition to 3x your Constitution modifier instead of 2x. You cannot develop an addiction to alcohol.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc30\"><strong>Surprise</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you attack a target with a weapon they did not know about (a hidden weapon or an improvised weapon from the environment that hasn’t been wielded or used to make an attack yet), you gain advantage on that attack roll.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.J13eLZetY3I4LpIq"}}}
{"_id":"8TOEsc8ha14IYv1R","name":"Creation Talents","content":"<h1>Alter Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Change Material</strong></h3>\n<p>You can alter an object, changing its composition from one material to another. You gain the following alter effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[mabfK5LH1fgehfvM]{Alter: Change Material}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Forge</strong></h3>\n<p>You can shape material with a touch. You gain the following alter effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[clHlT9TFN7VAxq54]{Alter: Forge}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>\n<p>You can convert any material into a more transparent version of itself. You gain the following alter effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[MCDGZnDUkLMDocXD]{Alter: Transparency}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Greater Alter</strong></h3>\n<p>You increase the effective of your destroy and repair abilities. You gain the following alter effects that replace their original version: </p>\n<p>@Item[Q5H23TMHkKqc2vHh]{Alter: Greater Destroy}</p>\n<p>@Item[vyI7jJVe3ppluhVJ]{Alter: Greater Repair}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Magnify/Minimize</strong></h3>\n<p>When using alter you can cause any object you can affect to increase or decrease in size. You gain the following alter effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[cZcPYixQl3pIog4p]{Alter: Magnify/Minimize}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc25\"><strong>Potent Alteration</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When altering an object, you can affect magical objects, worn or held objects, or creatures of the construct type. While this means you can repair broken magical items with your repair ability, you cannot restore the magic to such an object. If used against a creature or an attended object, the target creature or the creature wearing or holding the object is allowed a Constitution saving throw to negate the effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Create Talents</h1>\n<h3 id=\"toc14\"><strong>Alchemical Creation</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can create items that require mixing, such as acid flasks, alchemist’s fire, antitoxin, basic poison, and other, similar items at the GM’s discretion. You create only a single item appropriate for your size.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Catapult</strong></h3>\n<p>When you create an item, you may create it with momentum. You may apply any create talent to this as well. Y<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ou gain the following create effect: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Item[s2XlhOeLCmLCG93u]{Create: Catapult}</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Complex Creation</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you create an object, you can create a themed ‘creation’ that is made up of multiple different objects. For example, you could create a quiver full of arrows, or if creating a building you could include chairs, beds, barrels, etc.). You must be able to create all materials required for the complex creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you create an object two or more sizes smaller than your maximum, you can delay your creation so that rather than creating a single object once, it creates multiple identical objects over time. The total size of all created objects cannot exceed one size above your maximum create size. As a general rule, two objects of a similar size count as one size larger (2 Small objects equals a Medium object, 2 Medium objects equals a Large, etc.). You must set a parameter when this effect is created for when and where within range the items are created (for example, creating a new arrow in a quiver whenever the previous arrow is removed, or dropping a new anvil each round onto a target location, determined at the time of casting). This continues for the duration of the create effect or until the maximum size (or another limit, subject to GM approval) has been reached, whichever comes first.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Expanded Materials</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you create an object, you can work with any solid fragile material that is non-harmful and does not possess any unusual properties, such as glass, ice, or leather. You can also create harmless liquids like water (3 cubic feet equals a Small creature), but not gases or flesh. You can also make objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials required.</p>\n<p>As you gain levels, you also gain the ability to make steadily more materials, as detailed in the table below. Adamantine cannot be created or altered, except for the repair and destroy abilities, and created gems cannot be used as material components.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc19\">Table: Classic Substances</h4>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Materials</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>Basic metals (copper, iron, steel)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>Precious metals (gold, silver)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Specialty metals (mithril), gems</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Exquisite Detail</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Items you create are more intricate, and much harder to identify as fakes. You are proficient in ability checks made to create detailed or complicated objects and to any DC required to detect objects you create as magical fakes.</p>\n<p>If you are already proficient, you instead add twice your proficiency bonus. This does not stack with similar effects. Those attempting to detect magic on your created objects must pass a spellcasting ability check against your sphere DC to detect any lingering creation auras.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc22\"><strong>Magical Creations</strong></h3>\n<p>Objects you create are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc24\"><strong>Object of Force</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can create objects made of solid force. Force objects have no weight and remain rigid and unmoving in the location they are created, though a creature two sizes larger than the object can move it. Force objects are resilient and have resistance to all non-magical damage, and prevent incorporeal creatures from passing through them. Objects of force are translucent but easily noticeable and require no Perception check to see while imparting disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks to see through them. If you possess Transparency you can make the object invisible (as Illusion sphere’s Invisibility) or entirely opaque without spending an additional spell point, chosen at the time of its creation.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc27\"><strong>Restrictive Creation</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can create non-harmful objects directly on a creature. An unwilling target is entitled a Dexterity saving throw to avoid having an object created directly on it, causing the object to fall harmlessly to the ground. This means you can create bindings, manacles, or some other close-fitting prison directly onto the target, making them Restrained on a failed saving throw. Targets can still attack their own bindings (as outlined under Notes on Casings listed above).</p>\n<p>If you cover the target completely with a close-fitting prison they can only deal half damage to their bindings, but also have complete cover while inside their casing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3 id=\"toc14\"></h3>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Altering Burst</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can alter all unattended non-magical objects in a 10-foot radius around yourself. You can choose any number of materials that you can create within this area to be affected. (For example, you can choose to destroy a stone wall while leaving the wooden dresser resting against it unharmed.)</p>\n<p>If you possess the Reaching (metasphere) Universal talent, you can center this effect anywhere within range. When augmenting the effect with Potent Alteration, you can alter one worn or held or magical object, increasing by up to one at 5th level (2 objects), 11th level (3 objects, and 17th level (4 objects). These altered worn or held or magical objects are in addition to other objects in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Increase the radius to 20 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc26\"><strong>Precise Destruction</strong></h3>\n<p>You can destroy moving components and locks in lieu of disabling them more conventionally. When attempting to disable a complex device (such as a trap or lock) you can instead simply target the offending part of the object with destroy. You are treated as possessing thieves tools at all times and being proficient with those thieves tools and may make ability checks to open locks or disable complex devices using your casting ability modifier in place of the usual attribute modifier, but only when the desired action can be achieved by carefully destroying components (thus a door unlocked with this ability would be impossible to lock again without first repairing the lock).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

The target suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and ability checks made with that limb for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc9\"><strong>Chest Strike</strong></h3>\n<p>Your attack strikes the target’s chest. The target must pass a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc10\"><strong>Distracting Blades</strong></h3>\n<p>The target loses the ability to make opportunity attacks for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc11\"><strong>Face Strike</strong></h3>\n<p>You may expend your martial focus to target the target’s face, impeding their ability to see. The target must pass a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for one minute. Wiping the blood away as an Action ends this effect early.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc12\"><strong>Leg Slash</strong></h3>\n<p>The target’s movement speeds are halved for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc13\"><strong>Repositioning Strike</strong></h3>\n<p>You cause the target to stumble, letting you slip past them.

For a number of rounds equal to half your proficiency bonus, the target’s resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage is suppressed.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc15\"><strong>Wide Open</strong></h3>\n<p>Choose an ally other than yourself. That ally’s first attack against the target of this exploit made before the beginning of your next turn has advantage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"toc16\">Other Talents</h1>\n<h3 id=\"toc17\"><strong>Bind Weapon</strong></h3>\n<p>When performing a disarm, instead of making the target drop the item, you can bind their weapon to yours. This can be done with a target’s hand or natural attack as if it were a held weapon.</p>\n<p>As long as the creature’s item is bound, they cannot use it to make attacks and are considered grappled by you. They may let go of the item to break the grapple (if the item is not their hand or natural attack) but otherwise must break the grapple as normal to regain use of the item and be able to move.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc18\"><strong>Expert Feint</strong></h3>\n<p>You may perform a feint as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc19\"><strong>Fatal Opening</strong></h3>\n<p>Attacks you make with advantage gained from your use of feint score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc20\"><strong>Fencing Focus</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you successfully disarm or feint a target, you may regain your martial focus as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc21\"><strong>Footwork</strong></h3>\n<p>You may expend martial focus to move up to 10 feet. You may do this even when it is not your turn, and you do not need to spend a reaction to do so, and this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If done in response to an attack roll being declared against you, you impose disadvantage on that roll. If done in response to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw, you have advantage on that saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc22\"><strong>Greater Feint</strong></h3>\n<p>When making a feint, you may expend your martial focus to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, every creature’s first attack against that target has advantage until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc23\"><strong>Group Cover</strong></h3>\n<p>Your quick movements allow you to temporarily use one enemy as cover against another enemy. If a hostile creature attacks you, any other hostile creature adjacent to that creature takes disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc24\"><strong>Lunge</strong></h3>\n<p>As long as you have martial focus, you may increase the range at which you may make melee attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn but suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls made against adjacent targets until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc25\"><strong>Parry And Riposte</strong></h3>\n<p>When a creature strikes you with a melee attack, you may expend your martial focus as a reaction to attempt to parry that attack.</p>\n<p>Make a weapon or unarmed strike damage roll, and subtract the result from the damage of their attack. If this would reduce the damage of the attack to 0 or less, you may immediately make a single attack against the attacking creature; you may add an (exploit) talent to this attack as long as you don’t have disadvantage on it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc26\"><strong>Read Foe</strong></h3>\n<p>You have learned to read the subtle cues of your enemy.

As an Action or bonus action they may make a ranged spell attack roll using your key ability modifier against a single target within 30 feet. Creatures hit take [[/roll 1d6]] cold damage.

This works regardless of distance between them, as long as they are both within an unbroken area of Wind of severity 1 or higher and on the same plane. This allows them to speak and hear each other even if one of them is in an area of magical silence, though it does not allow them to use verbal components in such an area.</li>\n<li><strong>Defibulation (storm).</strong> While in an area of Storm of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle have advantage on any death saving throw they make.</li>\n<li><strong>High Energy (heat).</strong> While in an area of Heat of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points replenish at the beginning of each round.</li>\n<li><strong>Ice Box (cold).</strong> While in an area of Cold of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle and their equipment are protected against decay and can’t become undead. Additionally, mantled creatures have their time limit extended on when they can be raised from the dead, since rounds, minutes, and hours spent under the mantle don’t count against the time limit of such spells or magic sphere talents and abilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Load (aridity).</strong> While in an area of Aridity of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle may add your proficiency bonus to their Strength score when determining the amount of weight that they can carry.</li>\n<li><strong>Mist Form (precipitation).</strong> While in an area of Precipitation of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle are immune to opportunity attacks, and can enter and occupy the space of another creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Weathercaster</strong></h3>\n<p>Creatures with your mantle gain one of the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barometric Mantle (any).</strong> Creatures with your mantle may accurately predict the natural weather within 5 miles up to 48 hours into the future, and always therefore know if the weather is being magically manipulated. They also gain advantage on any saving throws against weather effects (including Weather sphere effects, such as shrouds).</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Skies (any).</strong> Creatures with your mantle treat weather as one step less severe, up to severity level 0. This and other (mantle) talents still work according to the true severity level. The mantled creature treats the weather as one additional step less severe at 5th level (2 steps), 11th level (3 steps), and 17th level (4 steps).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Weatherproof</strong></h3>\n<p>Creatures with your mantle gain one of the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gelid Body (cold).</strong> While in an area of Cold of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain resistance to cold damage and nonmagical slashing damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Mirage Sheen (heat).</strong> While in an area of Heat of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain resistance to nonmagical piercing damage and advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to disbelieve illusions.</li>\n<li><strong>Mummified Flesh (aridity).</strong> While in an area of Aridity of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain resistance to necrotic damage and nonmagical bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Nonconductive (storm).</strong> While in an area of Storm of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain resistance to lightning damage. Additionally, mantled targets gain advantage on all saving throws made to negate or reduce lightning damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Sodden (precipitation).</strong> While in an area of Precipitation of severity 1 or higher, creatures with your mantle gain resistance to fire and poison damage. Additionally, mantled targets can also douse nonmagical fires of Tiny size or smaller with a successful melee attack. The mantled target may also douse magical fires, but it requires a successful spellcasting ability check against the fire’s spell save DC or sphere DC. The size of the fire they may douse increases by one step at 5th level (Small size), 11th level (Medium size), and 17th level (Large size).</li>\n<li><strong>Wind Tunnel (wind).</strong> Ranged weapon attacks made against creatures with your mantle while in an area of Wind of severity 1 or higher are made with disadvantage. Additionally, mantled creatures do not automatically miss when launching ordinary projectiles at targets behind a wind wall (or similar effect).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Shroud Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Arctic's Shroud</strong></h3>\n<p>You learn to control cold-based shrouds.

{"_id":"E3BYDroC9MjrrNQl","name":"Telekinesis Talents","content":"<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many of the below talents detail the various augments that you gain for the @Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.xJShf9QNzquWJq56]{Catch}, @Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.gjcKaR4TlCkI56UU]{Levitate}, and @Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.g4PNK69TfrKOfS9U]{Projectile} abilities. Unlike other spheres and talents that typically limit the use of one talent at a time, many (catch), (levitate), and (projectile) talents can be stacked together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Catch Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Greater Catch</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain the following augments for catch. You cannot add both augments to the same catch.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you cast catch, you don’t have to immediately choose which projectiles you target. Until the start of your next turn, you can attempt to catch a number of targets up to 1 plus your proficiency bonus. Targeting a projectile in this way does not require an action.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Instead of targeting projectiles directly, you can create a kinetic field—a stationary flat surface to catch all projectiles and thrown objects passing through it until the beginning of your next turn. Any object that strikes the field immediately loses momentum and drops to the ground if the originator of the attack fails a Wisdom saving throw. This field is made up of no more than two 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.</p>\n<p>Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. The field can only stop valid targets of your catch, and does not block line of sight or line of effect. The field gains up to an additional panel at 5th level (3 panels), 11th level (4 panels), and 17th level (5 panels).</p>\n<p>You may concentrate to sustain a kinetic field for up to 10 minutes, and may move the field with you as you move. This can be combined with Telekinetic Maneuver to grapple targets that attempt to move through it until the beginning of their next turn (at which point they can try again).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Parry</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">You can use catch to block attacks with melee weapons, though the wielder retains its hold on their weapon even if you successfully block their attack. However, if you also possess the Steal talent, you can immediately apply it to a manufactured weapon as part of changing a catch into a levitate.</span></p>\n<p>Your telekinesis must be specially tuned towards the task, so if you ready an action to cast catch, you must specify whether you are attempting to intercept melee or ranged attacks.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Return</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you stop an attack with catch, you can immediately fling it back at the attacker if they’re in range. Resolve this attack as if it were a projectile, using the object you were attacked with. Doing so does not interfere with concentrating on other effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, a thrown weapon, or a telekinetic projectile, you can as a reaction make the projectile return back to you. You can automatically catch it when it returns without spending an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Telekinetic Maneuver</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can target any moving creature or object within your size limit, not just projectiles and thrown objects. If the target is unwilling, make a spell attack roll opposed by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice). On a success, you may either knock the target prone or give them the grappled condition until the beginning of your next turn. Being grappled by this ability can stop a creature from moving up or down as well, such as when used to stop an ally from falling. You can transform this ability into levitate without spending any additional spell points to target an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Gravity Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Gravity Shift</strong></h3>\n<p>You manipulate the gravity affecting an area, effectively increasing or decreasing the area's gravity. You gain the following gravity ability: </p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.D7ph6m7pTD5cLYTM]{Gravity Shift}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Gravity Well</strong></h3>\n<p>You can create a compact point of telekinetic force that draws everything towards it. You gain the following gravity ability: </p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.XVqTsw4r6ZXwR66k]{Gravity Well}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Speed Zone</strong></h3>\n<p>You can manipulate gravity in an area making it easier or harder to move.

You gain the following gravity ability: </p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.magic-abilities-sop.fuQO3EezNocekz3K]{Tether}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Levitate Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Dancing Weapon</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Your levitate ability gains the following augments, only one of which can be used at a time:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When using levitate on an object smaller than yourself, you can treat what you are lifting as a shield under your control. The object grants a +1 AC bonus (or its usual bonus, if it is an actual shield) to anything in its space, though creatures may still only benefit from a single shield at a time. The shield can be augmented by fighting styles, feats, and talents that affect shields, and if using a creature as a shield, attacks that miss the guarded target are instead redirected against the creature being levitated using the same attack roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When using levitate to move an object smaller than yourself, that object counts as a melee or ranged weapon (or improvised weapon) under your control. Your allies may count it as an allied creature occupying its space, you can use it to make attacks, opportunity attacks, and may apply weapon-based abilities (such as fighting styles, feats, and talents) to your actions with that weapon, as if you were wielding it in your hands. You may use your key ability modifier in place of Strength or Dexterity when making attacks with your dancing weapon, but otherwise it deals damage as normal for a weapon or improvised weapon of its type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Finesse</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Augment 0 sp:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Instead of moving a target to a different location, you can use levitate to perform fine manipulations, such as turning a key in a lock, unrolling a scroll, tying a knot, or using tools. You can make Dexterity checks at a distance, as well as making Wisdom (Medicine) checks to stabilize a creature. When performing an action at a distance, you can use your key ability modifier in place of the normal ability modifier, but you also suffer disadvantage on the check.</span></p>\n<p>When augmenting levitate to be maintained without concentration, you can use levitate to maintain complicated, non-combat procedures such as having cutlery prepare dinner, make a lute play itself, or making a shovel dig a ditch, all without spending the bonus action usually required to move the target.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Orbit</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Augment 0 sp:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> When you levitate a creature or object and move it into your space (or immediately after catching an object targeting you), you can place it in a passive orbit around you. An object in orbit drifts slowly around you, moving with you when you move as if you carried it, and does not require concentration to remain in orbit, though it does nothing except drift passively. At any point you can begin concentrating on it again to move it with levitate. You can have multiple objects around you at one time so long as their total size does not exceed your telekinesis maximum. If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you count as levitating anything in your orbit for the purposes of that talent.</span></p>\n<p>If the total size of the objects in your orbit is equal or greater than your size and are not being used with Dancing Weapon, you can grant yourself half cover (granting a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws as usual) until the start of your next turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>If the total size of the objects in your orbit is at least 2 sizes greater than your size and are not being used with Dancing Weapon, you can grant yourself three-quarters cover (granting a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws as usual) until the start of your next turn as an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Quick Motion</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Your levitate gains the following augment:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When using levitate you no longer need to spend a bonus action to move the target, although you may still only do so once per round.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Steal</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Augment 0 sp:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> You can use levitate on a creature’s worn or carried objects. You must make a ranged spell attack roll or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by that creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to your levitate movement in any direction. If an object is secured firmly or held in two hands, you have disadvantage on this check.

Creatures and unattended objects inside the area who succeed on a Dexterity saving throw take half damage from the projectile.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Homing</strong></h3>\n<p>When you or an ally misses with a ranged attack, yo ucan make the projectile home back in on the target.

If you throw such an object and you miss, you may redirect the attack against an adjacent creature, making a new attack against that creature instead. You may only do this once per throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><strong>Bounty Hunters Tools</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the bola, garrote, lasso, net, net crossbow, and whip.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc5\"><strong>Bruiser Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the battle axe, flail, greataxe, maul, morningstar, war pick, and warhammer.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc6\"><strong>Bushido Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the katana (longsword), longbow, naginata (glaive), nodachi (greatsword), tetsubo (maul), and wakizashi (shortsword).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc7\"><strong>Crossbow Expert</strong></h3>\n<p>You are proficient with all light crossbows, hand crossbows, heavy crossbows, and net crossbows.

When throwing a creature or object, you treat it as a weapon you are proficient in that deals bludgeoning damage and have the thrown (20/60) weapon property. Anything that increases your effective size for grappling or shoving (such as the Muscular Surge talent from the Brute sphere) increases your size for Rock Toss.</p>\n<p>Creatures and objects at least two sizes smaller than you are considered one-handed light weapons, while creatures and objects one size smaller than you are considered one-handed weapons. Creatures and objects your same size are two-handed weapons.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc18\">Table: Rock Toss</h5>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Object Size</th>\n<th>Damage Die</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you throw a creature at a wall or another creature, both the creature and the target suffer damage. You cannot throw an unwilling creature unless you have grappled that creature first.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc19\"><strong>Rogue Weapon Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the blowguns, garrote, hand crossbow, rapier, scimitar, short sword, and whip.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc20\"><strong>Staff Mastery</strong></h3>\n<p>You may treat the quarterstaff as if it had the reach weapon quality. When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon; this is considered two-weapon fighting. The opposite end of the weapon uses a d4 for its damage die and deals bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc21\"><strong>Toolkit Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You are so experienced with tools that a frying pan, a wrench, or a blacksmith’s hammer might be as deadly in your hands as a blade. When wielding a tool you are proficient with as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with that weapon. The tool’s damage dice is 1d4, but you may choose each round if you wish to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and you may use your key ability score, Dexterity, or Strength for attack rolls and damage rolls with these tools.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc22\"><strong>Unarmed Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You can treat your unarmed strikes as if they were finesse weapons, and they deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage. You may choose to treat your unarmed strike as having the light or versatile (1d6) properties, but not both simultaneously. Making a kick counts as using an unarmed strike with two hands with the versatile property.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent twice. If taken twice, you may treat your kick as a light weapon as outlined above, meaning you may make a kick to use two-weapon fighting even if your hands are full.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc23\">Other Talents</h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc24\"><strong>Armor Expert</strong></h3>\n<p>You ignore disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) imposed by medium armors and may treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of the time it takes to don or doff armor. If you take this talent a second time, you may apply these benefits to heavy armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc25\"><strong>Armor Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with light armor. If you are already proficient with light armor, you become proficient with medium armor and shields. If you are already proficient with light and medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor and shields. You may take this talent multiple times.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc26\"><strong>Artificer</strong></h3>\n<p>You have experience disassembling and assembling complex or foreign artifacts and mechanisms, whether they be arcane or technological. While you are not automatically proficient with alien technology, you gain advantage on all Intelligence checks made to figure out its use. The alien technology never permanently breaks from failing to figure it out.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc27\"><strong>Craftsman</strong></h3>\n<p>You are skilled at crafting and repairing gear. You gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools. When crafting a mundane item using a tool you are proficient with, you may do so in half the usual time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc28\"><strong>Dagger Bravo</strong></h3>\n<p>Your dagger weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. At 11th level, when you score a critical hit with a dagger, you roll an additional d4 when determining the extra damage for a critical hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc29\"><strong>Einhandler</strong></h3>\n<p>If an enemy misses with a melee attack against you while you are wielding a finesse melee weapon in one hand, and nothing else in any other hand, you may as a reaction make an opportunity attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc30\"><strong>Expert Reloading</strong></h3>\n<p>When wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, you may ignore the loading property if it has it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc31\"><strong>Garrote Grappler</strong></h3>\n<p>When you successfully deal damage to a creature with an attack action using a garrote, you may attempt to grapple that creature as a bonus action. If you expend martial focus, you may instead do so as part of making an attack of opportunity. Any time a creature attempts to escape your grapple and fails, it takes damage as if you had attacked it with the garrote.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc32\"><strong>Hand Crossbow Mastery</strong></h3>\n<p>When you make an Attack action with a one-handed weapon (including a hand crossbow), you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc33\"><strong>Impossible Reload</strong></h3>\n<p>You know how to use trick grips and nimble fingers to load ammunition into a one-handed ranged weapon, even when your other hand is full.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc34\"><strong>Mystic Fists</strong></h3>\n<p>When you have martial focus, your unarmed strikes are treated as though they were magic for the purpose of damage resistance. You may choose to deal slashing or piercing damage with your unarmed strike instead of bludgeoning damage. The choice of damage type is made when the attack is declared. If you possess Unarmed Training, your unarmed strike damage increases to d6, or d8 through the versatile property.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc35\"><strong>Point-Blank Shooting</strong></h3>\n<p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc36\"><strong>Polearm Guard</strong></h3>\n<p>While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, or spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc37\"><strong>Poison Blowgun Specialist</strong></h3>\n<p>While you are using a blowgun, you may increase the saving throw DC of any poison coating its ammunition by your proficiency bonus. If the DC of the poison is already calculated using a proficiency bonus (such as poisons created with the Alchemy sphere), you may expend martial focus to add your proficiency bonus on top of the already existing proficiency bonus to determine its saving throw DC.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc38\"><strong>Sling Combatant</strong></h3>\n<p>You may treat a loaded sling as if it were a club with the finesse weapon quality when making melee attacks with it. Any magical bonus to attack or damage also applies to your melee attack or damage roll.</p>\n<p>You may also launch items such as alchemist’s fire, acid, holy water, or formulae or poison from the Alchemy sphere as if they were ammunition, using the sling’s range instead of the normal throwing range of the item. Any magical bonuses to attack rolls the sling grants apply to attack rolls made in thisway.</p>\n<p>Finally, you may throw items from your sling lightly enough that the target can catch the item, with no attack roll required.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc39\"><strong>Spear Dancer</strong></h3>\n<p>You may treat any glaive, quarterstaff, halberd, spear, pike, or trident (or similar weapon with GM approval) you wield as though it had the finesse weapon property. You may treat the glaive, halberd, or pike’s two-handed property as if it were the versatile property. Using these weapons in one hand reduces the damage die by one step (1d12 becomes 1d10, 1d10 becomes 1d8, 1d8 becomes 1d6).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc40\"><strong>Splitshot</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you make an attack action with a bow, you can load two arrows and fire them as part of the first attack. When making an attack action in this fashion, your attack suffers disadvantage but can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other who are at least 20 feet away from you.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc41\"><strong>Throw Shield</strong></h3>\n<p>You are proficient with the use of shields as an improvised weapon, and you may treat shields you wield as having the thrown (20/60 ft.) property.</p>\n<p>If you have the Cover Ally talent of the shield sphere, you may treat any ally within your shield’s normal range as being within your shield’s reach by throwing it as part of the active defense. You may apply a (deflect) talent to this active defense as normal, performing any additional actions by ricocheting the shield off of the attack. If you have the Throwing Mastery talent, the shield returns after using Cover Ally as if you made an attack with it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc42\"><strong>Throwing Mastery</strong></h3>\n<p>When using a weapon with the thrown property to make a ranged attack, you may apply extra spin to the throw, causing the weapon to bounce back towards you after the attack resolves. As long as you have at least one hand free, you may automatically catch a weapon after it rebounds in this manner; otherwise, the weapon lands at your feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc43\"><strong>Unarmored Training</strong></h3>\n<p>Your deft movements, physical conditioning, and expert use of your chosen weapons allow you to create a protective barrier around yourself as effective as any true suit of armor. While you are wearing no armor and are not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + Dexterity modifier + your key ability modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc44\"><strong>Versatile Shield</strong></h3>\n<p>You may use a shield as if it were a second hand when wielding a glaive, halberd, spear, pike, trident (or similar weapon with GM approval), or a two-handed crossbow or firearm by bracing the weapon against the shield.</p>\n<p>If you are wielding a shield but not using it as listed above, you can use a bonus action after taking the Attack action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc45\"><strong>Whip Fiend</strong></h3>\n<p>You increase the base damage of whips you wield to 1d6. When you successfully deal damage with a whip, you may attempt to grapple the damaged creature as a bonus action. If successful, you may move up to half your speed to bring them adjacent to you as part of this bonus action.</p>\n<p>You may also use your whip to grab objects within its reach as an Action.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.bwGkI0DviZbyyP0s"}},"_id":"GnemeU4eaLgGfZFb"}

{"_id":"I4bkRc6pDYOPRPap","name":"Life Talents","content":"<h1>Cure Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Esoteric Healing</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Your cure ability affects undead and constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Fount of Life</strong></h3>\n<p>You can store a cure within yourself, allowing you to access that healing as needed throughout the day. You spend a spell point and roll the damage healed as normal, except rather than healing by the given amount, that amount of healing is stored. You can store multiple cures in this manner to increase the amount of stored healing, but you cannot store more healing within you than 10 times your level. Stored healing is lost when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p>You can draw on this stored healing to heal targets exactly as if using your cure ability, except you do not need to spend a spell point; you can choose the amount of healing granted (to a maximum amount equal to your stored healing), and any healing granted to a target is subtracted from your stored healing. A cure augmented with the Revitalize talent cannot be used to add to your stored healing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Greater Healing</strong></h3>\n<p>Your can empower your cure ability. You gain the following cure effect:</p>\n<p>@Item[9QflAIYDlvKSV4o5]{Cure: Greater Healing}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Revitalize</strong></h3>\n<p>You can choose to grant the target rapid healing instead of directly healing damage. You gain the following cure effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[nwoQKPWpQSMQ4Vz4]{Cure: Revitalize}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Invigorate Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Greater Invigorate</strong></h3>\n<p>You can empower your invigorate ability. You gain the following invigorate effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[IPkitZayBgnqp5wt]{Invigorate: Greater Invigorate}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Resuscitate</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> Your invigorate ability functions on creatures who have died within no more than 1 round, bringing them back to life. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target’s exhaustion level increases by 1, to a maximum of 5 and cannot be reduced below exhaustion level 1 by any means until completing a long rest. This ability requires a mostly intact body to function. This can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 3 sp:</strong> This functions as the augment above except you can target creatures who have died within the last minute.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Restore Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Break Enchantment</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can allow your restore ability to remove one magical effect from the target that has a duration. This may be used against curses including cursed equipment, although it does not remove the curse from the equipment, but instead suppresses the effect long enough for the item to be removed. If you do not specify a particular effect, a random one is selected. You must succeed at a spellcasting ability check against the sphere or spell save DC of the magical effect in order to remove it. This counts as using the remove curse spell against those spells and effects that specify they can only be removed through that spell. This has no effect on instantaneous effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Contagion</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you restore a creature, you can immediately attempt to inflict the conditions you just removed on another living creature within range of your restore ability. The creature targeted must succeed on a Constitution save against your sphere DC or they receive all the conditions you just restored. Immunity applies to these conditions as normal.</p>\n<p>These conditions last one round, regardless of the original duration of the restored conditions. If the creature succeeds on their saving throw, the original creature is still restored. If this is used in conjunction with the Mass (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, multiple enemies can be targeted, but each enemy can only receive conditions transferred from one ally and each ally must have all their conditions transferred to a single target.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Empathic Healing</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment -1 sp:</strong> You can restore others by taking on their injuries yourself. When you restore a creature empathically, you gain any conditions you removed from the creature as if you had been the one originally affected. You cannot transfer conditions that will kill you or conditions that are the result of ongoing effects.</p>\n<p>You cannot transfer effects that you are already affected by unless the effects are cumulative (so you can restore a level of exhaustion by increasing your own, but you cannot restore a disease that you already have). If restoring multiple conditions, you can select which conditions to transfer and which to leave untreated.</p>\n<p>If the effect causing the condition allows a save, you do not get a new save, though any effects on you that would protect you from the condition still function for the duration you have them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Greater Restore</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Your restore ability may reduce the target’s exhaustion level by 1 or remove any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores</li>\n<li>One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Restore Mind</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Your restore ability may remove any one effect causing one of the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charmed</li>\n<li>Frightened</li>\n<li>Stunned</li>\n<li>Unconscious</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Restore Movement</strong></h3>\n<p>Your restore ability can allow the target to stand up from prone or attempt a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to escape a grapple with advantage as a reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Your restore ability may remove any one effect causing one of the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Petrified</li>\n<li>Restrained</li>\n<li>An effect that reduces a target’s speed below its normal amount, such as a ray of frost spell or the Hindering Blast (blast type).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Andrenaline Surge</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you use a Life sphere ability on an ally (not yourself), you can also give them an adrenaline surge. The ally may do one of the following as a reaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make a single weapon attack</li>\n<li>move up to its speed</li>\n<li>make a Dexterity ability check to escape bonds, grapples, or other restraints</li>\n<li>draw, pick up, or ready a weapon or shield</li>\n<li>stand up from prone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you possess the Mass (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, you can spend an additional spell point to apply this augment to all affected creatures. Surges are resolved in initiative order.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Diagnose</strong></h3>\n<p>Allows you to learn any conditions that are affecting a living creature as a bonus action. You gain the following new ability: </p>\n<p>@Item[6ec8CWrot03VQTBV]{Diagnose}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Latent Healing</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> When you use cure or invigorate on a target, you can choose to delay its effects. You can apply effects that add additional hit points of healing at the time of the initial cure, such as additional hit points from Fount of Life. At any point, the subject of the effect can trigger its effects as a reaction. You can even target uninjured targets when using your abilities this way, though the effects can only be triggered when the target is injured. Healing delayed this way lasts until the target completes a short or long rest. A target can only be under the effects of one Latent Healing at a time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Restorative Cure</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When using your cure or invigorate abilities on a target or targets, you can restore them as well. Any augmentation costs incurred by the restore must be paid normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Advanced Talents</h1>\n<p>WIP</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}
{"name":"Athletics Talents","content":"<h1>Motion Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Dizzying Tumble</strong></h3>\n<p>Your rapid spins and twists leave a creature reeling. When you exit a space adjacent to a hostile creature, you may spend 10 feet of movement to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it takes disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Once a creature has succeeded on this save, it is immune to your use of this ability until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Moving Target</strong></h3>\n<p>When moving more than 20 feet during your turn, you gain half cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) against ranged attacks and spells until the start of your next turn. If you move at least 40 feet, you may expend your martial focus to increase this to three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws). If you take this talent a second time, the cover applies to melee attacks as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Sudden Flank</strong></h3>\n<p>If you successfully tumble through a hostile target’s space, you gain advantage on your next attack against that creature before the end of your turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Capoeria Spin</strong></h3>\n<p>You do not take disadvantage on attack rolls with unarmed strikes due to the prone condition. If you start your turn prone, you may stand up from prone as a bonus action, making a single unarmed attack simultaneously.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Close Quarters Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You can stand in or move through the space of a hostile creature and even make attacks from that space. You must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check opposed by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (the creature chooses); if you fail, your movement stops in the previous space and you provoke an opportunity attack from them. Attacks you make against a creature you are sharing a space with have disadvantage unless they are made with light weapons, natural weapons, or unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>If two creatures sharing a space in this way are of the same size, they grant each other half cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) against creatures not sharing the space. If one creature is larger, the smaller creature gains three-quarter cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), and the larger creature gains no cover. If this cover is enough to cause an attack to miss, resolve the attack against the other creature using the original attack roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Mighty Conditioning</strong></h3>\n<p>Any time you make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, you may use either Strength or Dexterity as your ability (your choice). You can use Dexterity instead of Strength to determine the distance or height you can jump.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Mobility</strong></h3>\n<p>Opportunity attacks made against you for moving out of a creature’s reach take disadvantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Multiple Motions</strong></h3>\n<p>When moving, you may expend martial focus to apply two (motion) talents to the movement.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Polearm Vaulter</strong></h3>\n<p>You no longer need to spend an action or pass a check to pole vault. Additionally, when pole vaulting, you can expend your martial focus as a bonus action to increase the distance jumped by an additional 10 feet or the height of a jump by an additional 5 feet regardless of your Strength (or Dexterity) score or remaining movement.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Powerful Wings</strong></h3>\n<p>If you can fly through the use of wings, you may hover.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Rope Swing</strong></h3>\n<p>You may attach an appropriate item to perform a rope swing as a bonus action, and dislodging it requires no action at all.</p>\n<p>When rope swinging, you may end your movement in the air (as if you had a fly speed) or even swing all the way up to the anchor point as a means of quick climbing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Rapid Motion</strong></h3>\n<p>You may take the Dash action as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Scale Foe</strong></h3>\n<p>You may make the Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check necessary to climb onto a bigger creature as a bonus action instead of an action. Creatures you have climbed on gain disadvantage on any attacks made against you (but not on attempts to dislodge you).</p>\n<p>If you possess the Bronco Buster talent of the Beastmastery sphere, you may use Strength (Handle Animal) checks in place of Strength (Athletics) checks when climbing on a bigger creature. If you have the Wrestling sphere, climbing onto a bigger creature counts as grappling them for the purpose of that sphere (within reason; you can’t use Choke Hold or Heel Tactics if you are not near the bigger creature’s neck or eyes, for example). If you possess the Close Quarters training talent, you gain its benefits while clinging to a bigger creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Strong Lungs</strong></h3>\n<p>You are practiced at quickly collecting a deep breath, drawing in more air in less time. This gives you the following benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain advantage on any saving throw against an effect that requires inhalation or causes suffocation.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made against exhaustion as part of a forced march.</li>\n<li>Multiply the number of rounds you can normally hold your breath by your proficiency bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Sure Grip</strong></h3>\n<p>The power in your hands is great. This gives you the following benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Athletics checks to climb or prevent falling and, as a reaction, may make an Athletics check to catch yourself or another creature within your natural reach when falling.</li>\n<li>You never drop held items when subject to the frightened, stunned, or unconscious conditions. This includes spells or abilities that cause you to drop held items in addition to being subject to one of these conditions (such as the Fear spell).</li>\n<li>If you are grappling a creature, your grapple does not end automatically if you become incapacitated.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Swift Movement</strong></h3>\n<p>When you have martial focus, all of your movement speeds increase by +10 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Training</strong></h3>\n<p>You become proficient in either Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you are already proficient in one, you may choose to gain twice your proficiency bonus instead. This talent may be taken more than once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Tumbling Recovery</strong></h3>\n<p>You may drop prone at any time, even when it is not your turn. Whenever you are knocked prone or drop prone, you may spend a bonus action or reaction to move up to 10 feet in any direction. If used to avoid an attack or area effect, this talent imposes disadvantage on the attack roll and gives you advantage on the Dexterity saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Unimpeded Positioning</strong></h3>\n<p>As long as you have martial focus, you ignore non-magical difficult terrain.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Unwilling Boost</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use the momentum of another creature’s attack to launch yourself. When your movement provokes an attack of opportunity from a creature of at least your own size, You may increase your movement speed for the round by 5 feet per point of the creature’s Strength bonus horizontally, or half that amount vertically. To do this, either the creature must strike you, or if they miss, you must use your bonus action to still use their attack to your advantage. Allies may choose to use their reaction to aid you as if making an attack of opportunity against you, but you still must use a bonus action to take advantage of their aid.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Wall Stunt</strong></h3>\n<p>You may run up or along walls as if they were flat ground, although you treat them as if they were difficult terrain. You may treat creatures at least two sizes larger than you as if they were walls (with GM discretion), but using a creature in this fashion provokes an attack of opportunity from them. You fall at the end of your turn if you are still on a wall in this fashion unless you have something to hold onto (including a creature, if attempting to climb onto a bigger creature).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Whirlwind Flip</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you succeed at a tumble check against a hostile creature, you regain your martial focus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7GpEjZOpGekVHyzL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"c0b8eae4217b2c86bd5cbd4db8f20409a88ffdf0","sourceId":"JournalEntry.e84nG542sriau5SR"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.e84nG542sriau5SR"}},"_id":"IEOVY9uPQrrHKTfi"}

Contact poisons may be thrown as if they were formula. Creatures that are hit by the attack are subject to the poison. Whenever you successfully perform a Dirty Trick or Steal action, you may expend your martial focus to subject the target to your contact poison as part of the same action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Controlled Rupture</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you use a formula or poison, you can select a number of individuals or 5-foot squares equal to your proficiency bonus that are not affected. Selected targets or creatures inside the selected squares do not suffer the effects of the formula or poison.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Delayed Application</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you create a formula or poison, you can choose to delay the effects up to a number of minutes up to half your level. You may expend two doses to instead delay the effects for a number of hours up to half your level. This delay takes place between when a creature is subjected to the formula or poison and when its effects manifest and does not influence how long a formula or poison remains potent after being applied but before the target is exposed to it.</p>\n<p>As a reaction, you may expend your martial focus to immediately trigger the effects of one delayed formula or poison you created within 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Gaseous Application</strong></h3>\n<p>You may prepare a formula as a gas instead of a liquid. A gaseous formula targets a 5-foot radius area within normal range (normally 20 feet), cannot be applied to a weapon, and no longer requires an attack roll. Creatures caught inside the area of effect suffer the effects of the formula, but are allowed a Dexterity saving throw to negate any negative effects if the formula does not already require a different saving throw. This has no effect on formula that can’t be thrown, such as war paint. If used with an alchemical item that’s already a gas, such as smoke bombs, this instead doubles the area.</p>\n<p>Clouds of gaseous formula grant their effects and then dissipate; the duration of its effects remain unchanged, but creatures cannot simply enter or re-enter the area to gain their effects.</p>\n<p>You may also prepare a poison as an inhaled poison; such poisons are counted as two doses for determining the number you may prepare. An inhaled poison targets a 5-foot radius area within normal range (normally 20 feet) and cannot be applied to a weapon. Creatures that enter or begin their turn within this cloud are subject to the poison. The toxic cloud dissipates after 1 minute, or a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Lasting Application</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you apply your poison to a weapon, the poison lasts for 1 additional successful attack before it is consumed.</p>\n<p>At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, it remains for an additional successful attack. Alternatively, you may apply a single dose of poison to up to 2 pieces of ammunition with a single action, plus one additional piece of ammunition at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<p>When you create an ingested poison and add it to any food or drink, it remains potent for up to 48 hours and becomes tasteless and odorless. You may expend two doses to have it instead remain potent for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Master Chemist</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with either alchemist supplies or poisoner’s kit. If you are already proficient with the chosen tools, you instead add double your proficiency bonus. This talent may be taken more than once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Master Herbalist</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the herbalism kit and can use an herbalism kit to craft formulae or poisons from the Alchemy sphere. If you are already proficient with the herbalism kit, you instead add double your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Quick Doses</strong></h3>\n<p>The amount of time it takes to create formula or poisons individually is reduced to 5 minutes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Risky Business</strong></h3>\n<p>You may expend martial focus to impose disadvantage to the target’s saving throw against the initial effects of your formula or poison. In addition, throwing a formula or poison against a creature while within 5 feet doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Skilled Applicator</strong></h3>\n<p>You may apply a formula or poison to yourself or a weapon you wield as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Specialized Venom</strong></h3>\n<p>You select one creature type (or two races of humanoid) from the ranger favored enemy list; your poisons may affect those creatures even if they would normally be immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. If not immune, you ignore any racial bonuses they may possess to saving throws against poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>\n<p>You may select an additional type (or two humanoid races) at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7GpEjZOpGekVHyzL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"b30139d66b5f5b1c269f0afc736e624073d3f93a","sourceId":"JournalEntry.oSEKaLsgMPLYdGBF"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oSEKaLsgMPLYdGBF"}}}

Unlike other spheres and talents that typically limit the use of one talent at a time, many (dispel) talents can be stacked together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Disorient</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you successfully counter a spell using Dispel, the caster must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or suffer disadvantage on all spell attack rolls and grant advantage on any saving throw made against their spells and magic spheres for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Fool's Counterspell</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you successfully counter a spell using Dispel, the caster must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw equal to your sphere DC, or believe the spell had its intended effect even if they would otherwise be aware of its failure. Treat this effect as an illusion with a duration equal to the countered spell, and use the rules for interacting and investigating illusions.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Greater Dispell</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can attempt to dispel any number of magical effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Shaped Dispell</strong></h3>\n<p>You can treat your Dispel ability as a (blast type) talent, shaping it with (blast shape) talents and using your destructive blast’s range when doing so. Your dispel does not deal destructive blast damage when used in this way. Augmentation costs for using these blast shapes apply as normal. Spell effects that must travel to their target through a space occupied by a blast shape with a non-instantaneous duration are also subject to the dispel effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Spellthief</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When you successfully counter a spell that targets a creature or object using dispel, you can instead choose to reassign the effect's targets. If you do so, you immediately take over concentration for the original caster (if the effect requires concentration), and the original caster cannot choose to prematurely end the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Vicious Dispell</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> If you successfully end an effect, the target takes 1d10 force damage, increasing by 1d10 at 5th (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Dual Sphere Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Alloy Enhancement (Enhancement, Nature)</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you use a geomancy ability from the metal package to create or affect a metal object, you can enhance the object as a bonus action. You can use this (dual sphere) talent even if your geomancy effect has a spell point cost of 1 or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Alloy Telekinesis (Nature, Telekinesis)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you create a metal object using any geomancy, you can use a Telekinesis sphere ability (usually levitate or projectile) on the object as a bonus action. You can use this (dual sphere) talent even if your geomancy effect has a spell point cost of 1 or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Aurora (Light, Weather)</strong></h3>\n<p>While in weather of severity 1 or higher, you can as a Light sphere effect magically increase the light level by one step as a bonus action (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes bright light). This change in light affects everything within your glow range. At 11th level, you can increase the light level by an additional step (darkness becomes bright light). Areas of magical darkness in range of this effect are unaffected, their light levels remaining unchanged.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Backdoor Control (Enhancement, Mind)</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you use a charm against a creature or object under the effects of your Bestow Intelligence, requests you make are treated as 1 step more reasonable. See the Mind sphere for details.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Baleful Storm (Death, Universal (Mass), Weather)</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">When thunder rolls and lightning cracks, your minions rise.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> While you are in a Storm weather category of severity 2 or greater, you can reanimate up to your proficiency bonus number of corpses within reanimate range each round as a bonus action without paying the normal reanimate spell point cost. You still cannot have more reanimated creatures active than your proficiency bonus with this ability, and the reanimated undead only lasts as long as you are in a Storm weather category of at least severity level 2. The reanimate cannot be further augmented.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Bioluminescent Transformation (Alteration, Light)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you shapeshift a target, you can also cause that target to glow. The glow ends automatically when the shapeshift does. If the glow is ended by a Dark sphere darkness or similar effect, it does not end the shapeshift. The shapeshift and brighten count as a single effect for the purposes of concentration. If you apply a (light) talent to a glow created and maintained this way, it counts against the number of traits you can grant with your shapeshift.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Coalescence (Death, Life)</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you use a ghost strike, you can before the end of your turn cast a cure, restore, or invigorate as a bonus action. You can use this (dual sphere) talent even if your ghost strike effect has a spell point cost of 1 or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Corpse Explosion (Death (Corpse Bomb), Destruction)</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use a destructive blast to activate your Corpse Bomb talent instead of a ghost strike. Affected targets are allowed a Dexterity saving throw for half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Destructive Companion (Conjuration (Explosive Companion), Destruction)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you summon a companion that possesses the Explosive Companion (form) talent, you can apply a single (blast type) talent that you possess to that companion. When the explosive companion detonates, it uses d8’s and the damage type of the (blast type) talent and applies its rider effects as if it were a destructive blast. Any additional spell point costs associated with the chosen (blast type) talent must be paid as part of casting summon.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Destructive Radiance (Destruction, Light)</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you use your destructive blast, you can choose to have it take on the properties of light. A destructive blast modified in this way can pass through solid objects that are transparent (such as glass), but cannot affect any creature or object that you cannot see. Possessing special senses that allow you to see through opaque substances does not let your destructive blast pass through the normally opaque solid object.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Dimensional Aegis (Protection, Warp)</strong></h3>\n<p>You sacrifice an aegis you have placed on another ally to swap places with them by using teleport. They must be within range of your teleport ability. The ally must be willing or unconscious. This can be done in response to an attack before the results of the attack are determined. If so, the attack changes target to whomever is now occupying the space previously occupied by the original target.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Enhanced Creation (Creation, Enhancement)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you create an object, before the end of your turn you can enhance it as a bonus action. The create and enhance count as a single effect for the purpose of concentration.</p>\n<p>Any enhance effect that would apply to attack or damage rolls apply to any attack or damage rolls made as part of dropping the object on a target. The bonus action enhance casting can be augmented to affect multiple created objects, if they were created since the start of your turn.

This renders the selected contents inaccessible until you spend another minute unlocking it, but while they are locked the contents do not suffer wear from age or from effects such as rust or rot while stored in this way, and time spent in the space does not count against the duration of abilities such as (enhance) talents, or time limits such as the time limit reviving a dead creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc43\"><strong>Swift Demise (Death, Time)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you use reanimate to create an undead with a basic (undead) talent, you can apply an alter time effect that targets a creature to the created creature as a bonus action before the end of your turn.

The state of the vegetation determines what types of undead you can reanimate; Barren dead branches could be reanimated as skeletons, rotting branches could be reanimated as zombies, while freshly chopped shrubbery could be reanimated as ghouls, etc. Mere limbing and bucking of wood generally doesn’t disqualify the vegetation as being a valid target for reanimate, but wood that has been made into proper lumber beams is not. The GM has the final say on what vegetation is and is not a valid target for reanimate, as well as what base creature is used when determining their CR and statistics; for example a topiary elk may use the base statistics of an elk, whereas a shambling wooden humanoid may use the base statistics of a thug.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your reanimate ability gains the following augment:</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Whenever you use reanimate to create a corporeal undead with a basic (undead) talent, you can infuse it with spores and plantlife. The reanimated creature loses the undead creature type and gains the plant creature type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc45\"><strong>Transform Object (Alteration, Enhancement (Animate Object))</strong></h3>\n<p>When you use Animate Object from the Enhancement sphere, you can apply a shapeshift to the target as a bonus action before the end of your turn. The enhance and shapeshift count as a single effect for the purpose of concentration. Use the shorter of the two effects’ durations, ending both when it expires. The bonus action shapeshift casting can be augmented to affect multiple targets with the Mass (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, if they were enhanced since the start of your turn. You can use this (dual sphere) talent even though your enhance effect has a spell point cost of 1 or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc46\"><strong>Twilight Adept (Dark, Light)</strong></h3>\n<p>Areas of darkness that you or your allies create can coexist inside areas of magical light effects that you or your allies create; both casters must agree to let their effects coexist for this talent to function. In areas where a darkness and magical light effect created by allies overlap, the area becomes dim light, while still providing additional effects as if it were an area of darkness or bright light, as applicable.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc47\"><strong>Twisted Reanimation (Alteration, Death)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you use reanimate to create an undead with a basic (undead) talent, you can apply a shapeshift to the created creature as a bonus action before the end of your turn. The reanimate and shapeshift count as a single effect for the purpose of concentration. Use the shorter of the two effects’ durations, ending both when it expires. The bonus action shapeshift casting can be augmented to affect multiple reanimated creatures with the Mass (metasphere) talent from the Universal sphere, if they were created since the start of your turn. You can use this (dual sphere) talent even if your reanimate effect has a spell point cost of 1 or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc48\"><strong>Vudu (Death, Illusion (Illusionary Disguise))</strong></h3>\n<p>You can grant your reanimated undead the benefits of the Illusionary Disguise talent, appearing as they did when they were alive. You do not need to know what the creature looked like when it was alive to gain this benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"toc49\"><strong>Warded Bones (Death, Protection)</strong></h3>\n<p>When you use reanimate to create an undead with a basic (undead) talent, you can apply an aegis to the created creature as a bonus action before the end of your turn.

If targeting a creature or its worn or held object, that creature may attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. Augmented darkness effects are anchored to, and move with the target. Affected creatures receive a new saving throw to end the effect each round at the end of their turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Directional Darkness</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Your area of darkness only blocks the light from one vantage point. If your darkness is in the form of a wall, it hampers vision from one side and appears clear from the other. If it is spherical, the caster may choose either for those within the area of darkness to see outside of it clearly or for those outside to see within clearly.

Additionally, your darkness can be used to counter or dispel sources of magical flame (such as an conjured wall consisting of fire) with a spellcasting ability check against the spell or sphere DC of the magical flame.

Divination talents benefiting from a single instance of Penetrating Divination may bypass obfuscation with a successful spellcasting ability check against your sphere DC. Those benefiting from a second instance of Penetrating Divination bypass Obfuscation automatically. Obfuscation does not affect the caster’s own divinations.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Obscure Passage</strong></h3>\n<p>You place a black circle on a surface, creating a temporary hole through a surface. You gain the following ability: </p>\n<p>@Item[R2QfQPLUiPCgVPtV]{Obscure Passage}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Rolling Blackout</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You gain the ability to move your areas of darkness. You can move one instance of darkness up to 30 feet as an action or bonus action, within the maximum range of the effect. If moving an area of darkness causes a creature to leave its area of effect, any ongoing effects the creature is under due to being inside that area of darkness end immediately.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Shadow Stash</strong></h3>\n<p>You can stash items in your shadow. You gain the following ability:</p>\n<p>@Item[P6kVL0cVl1UjtDSC]{Shadow Stash}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Wall of Darkness</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Rather than create a sphere of darkness, you can arrange your darkness as a number of 10-foot Cubes equal to twice your proficiency bonus. These cubes must be arranged contiguously, but otherwise may assume any shape. You must be able to perceive all areas your darkness will inhabit.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

You gain the following glamer effect: </p>\n<p>@Item[jYCMxIB1T83Ik1w5]{Glamer: Obscure}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Sensory Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Greater Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p>You may create a smell instead of a sound or an image when creating a figment. When augmenting your figments to include both sight and sound, they now can affect the senses of smell, taste, and touch as well. Illusionary swords feel sharp, illusionary food smells delicious (or terrible, as you choose) and illusionary fire feels hot, although the effect is all in the target’s mind and they cannot be made to actually suffer damage. Simply interacting with your figments or a target under your Illusionary Disguise does not reveal the deception anymore, although your illusions still do not have substance or weight (thus, a target feeling your illusionary wall will not immediately notice the deception, but a target attempting to run through or climb on the wall will still fall through, and ranged attacks would still penetrate the wall).</p>\n<p>Your kinetic figments become harmless, bland, and incorporeal to creatures that successfully disbelieve your figments.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Veiled Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p>You can grant your figments or creatures under your Illusionary Disguise an aura, or eliminate any aura they already have, such as altering how they detect through magic that detects magic, alignment, creature types, etc. Your Illusion sphere powers do not detect as being magical effects unless you choose to let them.</p>\n<p>A figment’s illusionary aura becomes obvious to a creature detecting its magic that disbelieves the illusion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Illusionary Obstruction</strong></h3>\n<p>You can create a kind of figment called an obstruction that, instead of creating the impression of an object, instead obstructs everything within its area. You gain the following ability: </p>\n<p>@Item[r2AZ4hdjUVKWWDO4]{Illusionary Obstruction}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Complex Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can split your figments into multiple independent illusions. Whenever you use your action to control a figment, you can control all of your figments with the same action. For example, instead of creating a dinner party with a single figment (in which case all of the guests and the table would need to be contained within your figment’s size), you could create one figment for the table and another figment for each guest, each of which could move independently within your illusion range.</p>\n<p>You can create up to three figments, but each one can only be half the size of your usual figments. The number of figments you can create increases at 5th level (four figments), 11th level (five figments), and 17th level (six figments).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Control Figment</strong></h3>\n<p>You can attempt to take control of a figment and command it as if it was your own. You gain the following ability: </p>\n<p>@Item[dpT1XlVjq6GjjLIb]{Control Figment}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Illusionary Terrain</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can create figments that alter the appearance of the terrain itself or other features of the area around you. For example, while you could previously cover a wall with a bigger wall or use an illusionary carpet to hide a pit, now you can use a figment that makes a wall of fire appear as a harmless wall of mist, or change the appearance of terrain from grassland to forest. Extreme changes (such as changing a warm grassland into a wintery tundra) may require additional (sensory) talents to be convincing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Insistent Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Choose one creature you can perceive. You give that target disadvantage on their next Intelligence (Investigation) check made to examine or disbelieve this figment, made within the next minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Potent Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p>Your figments can be so powerful that they can affect creatures in many ways, even if they disbelieve them. Depending on what (sensory) talents you possess, this could include blinding lights, thunderous noise, smells so strong they induce nausea, or even fire that can kill.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 3 sp:</strong> Creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or be blinded for the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> Creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or be deafened for one minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> If you possess Greater Illusions, creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage. The amount of psychic damage that a creature takes when it fails its saving throw increases by 1d4 at 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> If you possess Greater Illusions, creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or be poisoned for the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> If you possess Veiled Illusions, creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 2 sp:</strong> If you possess Intelligent Illusions, creatures who begin their turn within the area of your figment must make an Intelligence saving throw or be charmed for as long as they remain inside the figment. A creature who disbelieves the figment becomes immune to its charm effect, and the charm ends if it was being affected.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Programmed Illusion</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When creating a figment, you can cause it not to appear immediately, but instead to wait to activate when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. The trigger can be as general or detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the figment’s location. For example, you could create an illusionary monster that appears when someone opens a door, or a message that appears written in the air when someone says the correct word or phrase.</p>\n<p>Your figment has a permanent duration until triggered or dispelled (though you must still concentrate, unless using the augment to allow it to endure without concentration), though once triggered it performs a predetermined set of actions (set by you when it is created) with a maximum duration of 5 minutes, after which the figment disappears and the effect ends. If this figment is also altered with Permanent Illusion, then it will reset after 5 minutes, activating again the next time it’s trigger happens.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Selective Illusions</strong></h3>\n<p>You can designate creatures to automatically disbelieve your figments, or to be immune to (figment) or (glamer) talents you use.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can choose to have a total number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus automatically disbelieve or be immune to this illusion.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}

If you brighten the glow, it sheds bright light in a 5 foot radius around all squares it passes through, with dim light 5 feet beyond. If you return the light’s area to normal or change between (nimbus) talents, any trail left behind is removed immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Other Talents</h1>\n<h3><strong>Area Glow</strong></h3>\n<p>You create an eruption of light, causing all creatures within an area to glow.

When you create a glow, you can choose a number of 5-foot cubes in the area of light it produces, up to a maximum of a number of cubes equal to your proficiency bonus. These cubes do not need to be contiguous. The selected area is unaffected by your glow; its light level does not change, and it is not subject to the effects of any (glow) talents applied to the glow. If the glow moves, this omitted area moves with it. You can alter what areas are affected and unaffected by your light with no action required on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Black Light</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can cause any glow within your range to shed non-visible light. While shedding non-visible light, a glow does not outline a creature with light, impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, or increase light levels within its radius. However, (glow) talents applied to the glow still function as if it was shedding light in its normal area. This augment may be applied or removed from a glow within range without any required action on your turn. Creatures can still perceive the area of the effect.</p>\n<p>A glow shedding non-visible light functions normally even in magical darkness and does not hinder the function of magical darkness in the same area. No magical skill check is made when a glow under the effects of Black Light interacts with magical darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Dancing Lights</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can create a glow effect without the need for a creature or object. This allows you to create a floating ball of light that may fly up to 60 feet per round and may be directed without action cost on your turn. You can give these lights simple commands, such as following a creature you can see or traveling in a specified pattern.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Dual Light</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can simultaneously apply two (glow) talents you possess to your glow. The effects of each talent is resolved separately. Any augmentation costs from the (glow) talents must be paid separately. This augmentation may not be used in conjunction with the Daylight advanced talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> You can apply two (nimbus) talents to a single glow effect, causing it to shed light in the area defined in both (nimbus) talents. Alternatively, you can choose to apply a single (nimbus) talent while also shedding light in the normal radius of your glow, or apply a single (nimbus) talent twice. Creatures in overlapping areas are still only affected by (glow) talents and other effects of your glow once.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When applying a lens, you can apply a second lens as part of the same casting. Both are considered a single effect for concentrating, augmenting duration, dispelling, and similar effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Flare</strong></h3>\n<p>You expend one of your glow effect, causing it to blaze up momentarily before dying. You gain the following ability: </p>\n<p>@Item[gK9qInPXNyS9IN5S]{Flare}</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Flash</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">You can choose to apply the effects of (glow) talents at any point during your turn instead of only at the end of your turn. You can still only apply the effects of (glow) talents once per turn.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> As a bonus action, you can apply the effects of a (glow) talent an additional time in a single round. This additional application may be activated separately from any other application of your (glow) talents. This allows your (glow) talent to affect a different area if the glow has moved or the area of its light has changed, but does not let you affect any given area more than once per round.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Glory</strong></h3>\n<p>When you brighten a glow on yourself and only yourself, it lasts for its duration without concentration. The radius of the bright light so created is reduced to 5 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Intensity Control</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You can add or subtract up to 10 feet from the radius of your dim and bright light. If you possess talents that would alter the area of your light, such as the Illuminate talent, this increased or decreased radius is added in before the area is multiplied. You can alter the area of your light as a free action, but for the purpose of (glow) talents you can still only affect one area per round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> So long as you do not apply any (glow) talents to your glow, you can double its radius. You cannot alter the area of light shed by the Glory talent with Intensity Control.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Light Link</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> You always know the direction and distance to any creature or object under the effect of your glow. This has no effect if the creature or object is on another plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Style</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Augment 0 sp:</strong> Your glows may be composed of multiple colors, allowing you to outline or highlight specific portions of a glowing object or create art. When you brighten your glow, you can also create patterns and different colors in the light it sheds, casting intricate designs on surfaces. These patterns may be highly detailed and complex, though creating art of high craftsmanship requires you to succeed on an appropriate check (usually Charisma (Painter’s Supplies)). You determine and create the pattern as part of making the glow, but may change it once per turn without spending an action.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can cause one of your glows that is shedding bright light to stain a surface with its light, painting its current pattern on any portion of the glow’s area. The ability to stain a surface is an instantaneous effect, so the resulting stain is non-magical and functions as a mundane dye that cannot be dispelled, though it may be cleaned off or painted over. Unwilling targets may make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being stained, and a 5-foot cube may be cleaned of these stains with a full minute of work.</p>\n<p>If you also possess the Dancing Lights talent, you can alter the shape and appearance of your light. It may be as large as a full 5 foot cube, or as small as a mote of dust, though its size has no impact on the light it sheds. Regardless of how intricate or well shaped your Dancing Light is, it is impossible to mistake as anything other than a magical light.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}
