This stacks if a target is hit multiple times.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc23\">Belladonna</h2>\n<p>Belladonna is a powerful poison, but in your careful hands can have many beneficial effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You grant a willing creature you can touch immunity to lycanthropy (suppressing any transformation they might be under). They also gain resistance to damage from natural weapons such as claws, fangs, spines, or horns. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> The target must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc24\">Brimstone</h2>\n<p>Brimstone, also known as sulfur, can ward off illness and disease when used in small and controlled amounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You fortify a target you can touch with brimstone, granting proficiency on Constitution saving throws for 1 minute. Any time a creature attempts to bite them or swallow them whole, that creature must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> You infuse the flashbang with brimstone, causing it to burn and smoke. The target suffers 1d6 points of fire damage, increasing by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level. In addition, the 5 ft. square where the flashbang exploded fills with smoke, becoming lightly obscured. The smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute, or is dispersed in 1 round by strong winds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc25\">Lodestone</h2>\n<p>Lodestone’s unusual properties often seem like magic to the uninitiated, but to you, it is a predictable and reliable tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You draw one primarily metal item or creature within 30 feet and no more than Medium size directly towards yourself or directly away from yourself. If it is a living creature or an item held or worn by a living creature, you must succeed on a key ability check contested by the target’s Strength check. Items are pulled into your hand or thrown 30 feet away, while creatures (or the creature inside metal armor) instead move 10 feet towards or away from you. This movement provokes opportunity attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> Your flashbang magnetizes the target. For 1 round, attacks against the target made with metallic weapons or by metal creatures are made with advantage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc26\">Magnesium</h2>\n<p>You have learned to manipulate magnesium, which burns at extreme temperatures and sheds a brilliant white light.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You can create a brilliant magnesium torch in your hand that lasts for 1 hour and can be wielded as a club, dealing 1d6 fire damage in addition to its normal damage. This torch sheds bright light for a 30 feet radius and normal light for an additional 30 feet. On a critical hit, the target of your attack catches fire. The target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> The target is blinded for 2 rounds on a failed saving throw instead of 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc27\">Ooze</h2>\n<p>Your alchemical studies branch out into learning how to cultivate, manipulate, and establish mastery over the strange creatures known as oozes.</p>\n<p>You can grow a creature of the ooze type in a specially prepared vial during a long rest. The ooze must have an intelligence of no greater than 2 and a CR of no greater than 1/4 your class level. You can only have a total number of domesticated oozes equal to half your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You release an ooze from its vial, allowing it to quickly reconstitute and aid you on the battlefield. The ooze understands basic commands such as “attack,”, “defend,” or “move” from you and follows them to the best of its ability, but otherwise can’t be commanded. You can re-capture an ooze as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>These domesticated oozes are volatile; if an ooze moves more than 100 feet away from you or if you release a new ooze without reclaiming the old one, the first ooze begins to lose cohesion and dissolves 2 rounds later, regardless of whether or not it returns to your side during that time. If an attack splits an ooze, you retain control of one of the oozes (chosen at the time the split occurs), and the other also dissolves 2 rounds later.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> Your flashbang deals 1d6 points of acid damage, increasing by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level. The flashbang’s normal Constitution saving throw to avoid being blinded and deafened is replaced with a Dexterity saving throw.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc28\">Salt</h2>\n<p>Salt is known for its ability to ward off demons, undead, and other magical creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate:</strong> You carefully lay out a 10 feet diameter circle of salt around yourself, creating a protective circle. While within this circle, a creature gains advantage on saving throws against magical effects originating from outside the circle. Summoned creatures and incorporeal undead cannot cross the circle of salt and cannot physically touch creatures if they must cross the circle to do so unless a creature inside the circle takes a hostile action against them, in which case they can touch that target normally. Summoned creatures cannot break the circle, though other creatures can do so as an action. Once the circle is broken, all of its benefits end.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashbang:</strong> The flashbang disrupts magical energies. Make a key ability check against a DC of 10 + the spell level of the lowest level magical effect on the target. On a successful check, the magic effect ends.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nqJWYzTLZ2DciEbV":3},"flags":{}}
